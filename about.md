My name is Jefkine Kafunah. I am a researcher and software engineer interested in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, NLP, data compression, data structures and algorithms.
I'm also the author of [zeta-learn](https://zeta-learn.com/){:target="_blank"} a minimalistic python machine learning library designed to deliver fast and easy model prototyping.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to email me on jefkine@gmail.com or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jefkine){:target="_blank"}.
